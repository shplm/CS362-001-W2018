The first bug I found in your code is in Appt.java file.

It happens as you incorrectly fix in line 121. It makes your condition as:

	"if(startDay<0 || startDay>NumDaysInMonth)"
That can be represented that "startDay = 0" can be true but not logically correct in words.

And here is a relavent test for meet this bug in my code:
Printout result:
Running calendar.ApptTest
	1/0/2018 at 9:30pm ,Birthday Party, This is my birthday party.
That is totally incorrect.

My suggestion to fix this is just to simply change back from "startDay<0" to "startDay<1" to prevent user type in startDay=0 as a logic error.

The second bug I found in your code is in Appt.java file also.

It happens from professor's raw code at line 113.

It will make whole test file crashed accidentally as a error.

Here is few lines of error message printout for this bug:
	java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 99
	...

However, to approach the whole branch coverages in line 124, user has to type in some invalid value for testing.

So, here is my suggestion to fix this bug:
Switch order of testing if-conditions for line 121, 122 and line 124, 125.
To first guarantee input month is correct, then generate variable "NumDaysInMonth" and enter into "startDay" test.

And the code after fixing:


int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth-1);
id isValid() {
    if(startHour<0 || startHour>23)
        this.valid=false;
    else
        if(startMinute<=0 || startMinute>59)
            this.valid=false;
        else
            //start fix here
            if(startMonth<1 || startMonth>12)
                this.valid=false;
            else
                int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth-1);
                if(startDay<0 || startDay>NumDaysInMonth)
                    this.valid=false;
                //end fix here
                else
                    this.valid=true;
}
